/*
    For this section of the assessment you will be putting together a cheat sheet for common git commands.  
    You'll provide the command as well as what it does. 
*/

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitDefinition'.
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what Git is.
*/

//CODE HERE
let gitDefinition = "Git is a way to save and track code from a local repository, also used to navigate all files/folders on your machine in a faster fashion. Git can also be used to make working on project with multiple people much easier."

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitHubDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what GitHub is.
*/

//CODE HERE
let gitHubDefinition = "Github and git are commonly used together but arent the same. Github is where you can find other peoples project code that they have uploaded to get saved, this feature is mostly used for people that you are working with to see changes made to the code that was made. Almost like a code social media."

//////////////////PROBLEM 3////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitInitDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git init' does.
*/

//CODE HERE
let gitInitDefinition = "Git init initializes a project file or folder, this adds a local repository to your machine and also adds a hidden git file. This step is needed to be able to stage, add, commit, and push later on. "

//////////////////PROBLEM 4////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitCloneDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git clone' does.
*/

//CODE HERE
let gitCloneDefinition = "Git clone does as the name suggests, it clones/copies an existing git repository to be added to a new location on your machine or remote machine."

//////////////////PROBLEM 5////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitStatusDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git status' does.
*/

//CODE HERE
let gitStatusDefinition = "Git status displays what files are staged and shows what changes have already been staged. A very good way to check if everything is working correctly in terms of commiting and adding."

//////////////////PROBLEM 6////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitAddDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git add' does.

    Create another variable called 'gitAddCode'.  
    It should be a string containing the code to add all files.
*/

//CODE HERE
let gitAddDefinition = "Git add is used to get the working directory ready for a commit, it stages the code to be ready. While Git add on its own doesnt change the code or the directory in any way it is still needed for commiting changes."

let gitAddCode = "git add ."
//////////////////PROBLEM 7////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitCommitDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git commit' does.

    Create a variable called 'gitCommitCode'.  
    It should be a string containing the code to commit using the message "initial commit".
*/

//CODE HERE
let gitCommitDefinition = "Git commit adds the files that have been staged to your local repository, this is very difficult to undo so it is best to be absolutely sure that what you are commiting is ready and the message reflects what has been commited. "
let gitCommitCode = 'git commit -m "initial comment"'

//////////////////PROBLEM 8////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitPushDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git push' does.
*/

//CODE HERE
let gitPushDefinition = "Git push is the command that is used to upload a local repository to a remote repository. As an example this is what you would use to upload all the files that were worked on to github"
