/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
let analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, this would still be considering a sub-section of the planning stage. This step is where its figured out what is going to be needed for the project, for example if a feature is going to be added to connect with other people or specific features that will be added. "
let design = "This is the third step, this is where the software is determined on how it will work. Specifies what language will be used, how the users would interact with said application, how it runs relative to servers(communicates with servers)"
let implementation = "This is the fourth step, all the design that was thought up and figured out in the previous step is now going to be turned into code to make it an actual application. Hence why its called implementation, you are implementing the design as code."
let testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step, this is where all the code that has been implemented is tested to make sure the application runs smoothly and how its supposed to. Its also a way to catch and fix bugs before pushing it out to the public and make changes to better suit what is wanted."
let maintain = "this is the final step, maintaining a project is a constant step meaning after the code has been deployed to the public the team is able to get feedback from real-world use and see if there are any problems that slipped through the cracks or what can be changed to make user satisfaction better. An application is constantly being updated and this is a primary reason."
